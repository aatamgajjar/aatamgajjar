Hi, I’m @aatamgajjar! I work at the intersection of data science, chemical process engineering, and scientific computing. My interests lie in developing data-driven models for:

- Process modeling, monitoring, and control
- Fault identification, fault diagnostics, and anomaly detection
- Energy optimization and load-shift algorithms

I’m open to collaborate on process modeling, data science projects in process systems engineering, data analytics in energy conservation. In my free time, I use data skills for sports/cricket analytics and projects.
- How to reach me- aatamgajjar@gmail.com or reach out to me on www.linkedin.com/in/aatamgajjar

I will (mostly) post my side projects and things I’m learning on here!
